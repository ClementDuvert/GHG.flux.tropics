# GHG.flux.tropics

The GHG.flux.tropics package consists of MATLAB scripts designed to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from river and lake datasets in tropical and subtropical regions. The package enables the following:
- Uploading and preprocessing of GHG data for rivers and/or lakes.
- Standardisation of units.
- Generation of mean or median values per site and system.
- Estimation of median fluxes per climate region and system size (e.g. Strahler order) using a bootstrapping approach.
- Scaling of these fluxes to the broader (sub)tropics.

The package includes the necessary raw data files and is related to the following article: Duvert C. et al. (2025) Hydroclimate and landscape diversity drive highly variable greenhouse gas emissions from tropical and subtropical inland waters, Nature Water 3, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-025-00522-8.

### System requirements
- MATLAB version: R2022a Update 1 or later.
- Required toolboxes: Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Optimization Toolbox.
- Hardware: No specific hardware requirements beyond standard MATLAB-compatible devices.

### Instructions
1. Set up directories. Ensure that all input datasets and scripts are either in the working directory or add their location as follows:
```MATLAB
addpath('/Users/...') % Add the directory where functions and/or datasets are stored
```
2. Run the analysis. Start by running the call_functions.m script, which manages the execution of all subsequent functions in the package. To begin, type the following command in MATLAB's command window:
```MATLAB
call_functions
```
A pop-up will prompt you to select whether to analyse river or lake data.

### Expected outputs
Each function generates specific outputs, as detailed in the header of each script. Key outputs are displayed in MATLABâ€™s command window as the functions run.
The expected run time for the river data is between 45 seconds and 2 minutes, while the expected run time for the lake data is between 20 seconds and 1 minute.
